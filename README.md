## Note
### About `Realtime` Priority
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/scheduling-priorities#priority-class
>You should almost never use `Realtime`, because this interrupts system threads that manage mouse input, keyboard input, and background disk flushing. This class can be appropriate for applications that "talk" directly to hardware or that perform brief tasks that should have limited interruptions.
